Hi there! If you're looking for a high-performance gaming mouse that balances top-tier features with great value, I’d recommend the Logitech G Pro X Superlight. It offers wireless connectivity, an impressive max DPI of 25,400, and a sleek, lightweight design—perfect for fast and precise gameplay. Plus, at $110 per unit, it’s more cost-effective overall compared to the Logitech G502 X Plus, which, while packed with extras like RGB lighting and both wired and wireless options, comes at a higher price point.

If budget is your main concern, the Razer DeathAdder Essential is a solid, affordable option, but keep in mind it’s wired-only and has a lower max DPI, which might limit performance in more competitive gaming scenarios.

Ultimately, for a blend of excellent performance, wireless freedom, and value, the Logitech G Pro X Superlight stands out as the best choice. Let me know if you'd like more details or assistance placing an order!
