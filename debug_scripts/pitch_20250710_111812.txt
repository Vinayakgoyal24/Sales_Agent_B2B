Hi there! If you're looking for a top-notch gaming mouse, I’d recommend the Logitech G Pro X Superlight. It offers wireless freedom, an ultra-responsive optical sensor with a max DPI of 25,400, and comes in at a great price point — $110 each, which is more budget-friendly than the Logitech G502 X Plus. While the G502 X Plus does have wired and wireless options plus some cool RGB features, it’s quite a bit more expensive. On the other hand, if you’re on a tighter budget, the Razer DeathAdder Essential is a solid pick but with lower DPI and wired-only connection, so it might not keep up with intense gaming sessions. Overall, the G Pro X Superlight strikes the perfect balance between performance, convenience, and price — ideal for serious gamers who want high-end features without overspending. Let me know if you’d like me to arrange a quote or answer any questions!
