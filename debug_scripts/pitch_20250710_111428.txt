Hi there! Looking for the perfect gaming mouse? Let me help you choose. If you want top-tier performance with wireless freedom and a high max DPI of 25,400, the Logitech G Pro X Superlight is an excellent choice. It offers sleek design, precision tracking, and comes in at a great price point—$110 each, saving you over $150 compared to the Logitech G502 X Plus. 

Now, if you’re after premium features like wired or wireless options and customizable RGB lighting, the G502 X Plus is fantastic but comes at a higher cost. On the other hand, if budget is your main concern and you’re okay with wired connection and a lower DPI, the Razer DeathAdder Essential is a solid, affordable pick.

Overall, for a balance of performance, wireless convenience, and value, I’d recommend the Logitech G Pro X Superlight. It’s a great way to boost your gaming setup without breaking the bank. Let me know if you want to move forward or have any questions!
