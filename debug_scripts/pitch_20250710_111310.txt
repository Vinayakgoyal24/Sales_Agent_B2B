Hi there! If you’re in the market for a top-tier gaming mouse, I highly recommend the Logitech G Pro X Superlight. It delivers outstanding performance with a max DPI of 25,400—almost matching the higher-end Logitech G502 X Plus—but at a more affordable price of just $110 per unit. Plus, it’s fully wireless, giving you the freedom to game without cable clutter, which is a huge advantage for a clean and flexible setup.

While the G502 X Plus offers a wired/wireless option and a slightly higher DPI, it comes at a premium cost, which adds up significantly when purchasing multiple units. On the other hand, the Razer DeathAdder Essential is budget-friendly but falls short in performance and features, making it less ideal for serious gamers.

Overall, the Logitech G Pro X Superlight strikes the perfect balance between price, performance, and wireless convenience, making it the smart choice for equipping your team with 11 high-quality gaming mice. Let me know if you’d like to move forward or have any questions!
