Hi there! If you're looking for top-notch gaming mice, I’ve reviewed three great options for you. First, the Logitech G502 X Plus offers impressive features like wired and wireless connectivity, a max DPI of 25,600, and customizable RGB lighting—but it comes at a higher total price of about $1,360 for 11 units. On the other hand, the Razer DeathAdder Essential is the most budget-friendly option at just under $242 total, but it has a lower max DPI of 6,400 and only wired connectivity, which might limit your gaming performance.

Now, if you want the best balance between performance and cost, I recommend the Logitech G Pro X Superlight. It delivers nearly the same ultra-high DPI as the G502 X Plus, is fully wireless for convenience, and comes in at a lower total price of around $1,210 for 11 units. This makes it an excellent choice if you want high-end features without stretching your budget. But if RGB lighting and dual connectivity are must-haves for your setup, then the G502 X Plus would be the way to go. Let me know if you'd like me to help you place an order or if you have any questions!
