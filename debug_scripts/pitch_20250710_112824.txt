Hi there! I’d love to help you find the perfect gaming mouse. Looking at the options, the Logitech G Pro X Superlight really stands out as an excellent balance of performance and value. It offers wireless freedom, an impressive max DPI of 25,400, and a sleek, lightweight design—all for a total cost that’s notably less than the Logitech G502 X Plus. 

While the G502 X Plus does have some extra features like wired and wireless connectivity plus RGB lighting, it comes at a higher price point. On the other hand, if budget is a major consideration, the Razer DeathAdder Essential is the most affordable but has lower DPI and only wired connectivity, which might limit your gaming precision and speed.

So, if you want top-tier performance with wireless convenience and great value, the Logitech G Pro X Superlight is the way to go. But if you prefer additional features like RGB or wired options, the G502 X Plus is a solid choice. Let me know if you’d like me to help you with the next steps!
