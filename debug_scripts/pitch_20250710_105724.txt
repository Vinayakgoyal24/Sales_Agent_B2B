Absolutely! If you’re looking for a top-tier gaming mouse that combines high performance with great value, I highly recommend the Logitech G Pro X Superlight. It features an impressive max DPI of 25,400, which is almost on par with the premium Logitech G502 X Plus, but at a more affordable price point—$110 per unit versus over $120. Plus, it’s fully wireless, giving you the freedom to game without cable clutter or restrictions, enhancing your setup’s flexibility.

While the G502 X Plus offers wired and wireless options and the highest DPI, it comes at a significantly higher total cost. And although the Razer DeathAdder Essential is budget-friendly, its lower DPI and wired-only design make it less ideal for serious gaming.

So for 11 units, the G Pro X Superlight delivers the best balance of performance, price, and convenience—making it the smart choice to elevate your gaming experience. Would you like me to help you proceed with this option?
