Hi there! I’d love to help you choose the perfect gaming mouse for your setup. Looking at your options, the Logitech G Pro X Superlight really stands out. It offers wireless freedom, incredibly high DPI at 25,400, and excellent performance—all at a more affordable total price of $1,210 for 11 units. It’s a great balance between premium features and cost efficiency.

If you’re after top-tier customization with RGB lighting and don’t mind the wired or wireless flexibility, the Logitech G502 X Plus is fantastic but comes at a higher total cost of $1,360. On the other hand, the Razer DeathAdder Essential is the most budget-friendly option, but with a lower DPI and wired-only connection, it might not meet the demands of more competitive gaming.

So, if you want the best mix of performance and value, I’d recommend going with the Logitech G Pro X Superlight. Let me know if you’d like to proceed or have any questions!
