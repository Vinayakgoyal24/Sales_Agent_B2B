Hello! I wanted to share some insights on the gaming mice options you've been considering. If you're looking for the best balance between high performance and cost efficiency, the Logitech G Pro X Superlight is a fantastic choice. It offers wireless connectivity, a max DPI of 25,400, and a sleek black designâ€”all at a total price of $1,210 for 11 units, which is more budget-friendly compared to the Logitech G502 X Plus.

Now, if RGB lighting and a wired connection are must-haves for your setup, the G502 X Plus is still a strong contender, featuring an impressive max DPI of 25,600, though it comes at a higher total cost of $1,360. On the other hand, if budget constraints are tight and you're okay with a lower DPI and wired-only connection, the Razer DeathAdder Essential is the most economical option at just $241.89 for 11 units.

Overall, for top-notch wireless performance without stretching your budget, I recommend the Logitech G Pro X Superlight. Let me know if you'd like help moving forward with this or have any other questions!
