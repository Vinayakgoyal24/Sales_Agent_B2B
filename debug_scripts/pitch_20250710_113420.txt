Hi there! I’ve reviewed the options for your gaming mouse needs, and here’s what I recommend. If you’re looking for a top-tier, high-performance mouse with wireless convenience, the Logitech G Pro X Superlight is an excellent choice. It offers a max DPI of 25,400, wireless connectivity, and comes in at a more affordable total cost of $1,210 for 11 units. This gives you great value without compromising on performance.

On the other hand, if RGB lighting and a wired connection are must-haves for your setup, the Logitech G502 X Plus is fantastic, featuring an even higher max DPI of 25,600 and both wired and wireless options—but it’s a bit more expensive at $1,360 total.

For those on a tighter budget, the Razer DeathAdder Essential is the most affordable at just under $242 total. However, with a max DPI of 6,400 and wired-only connection, it might not meet the needs of serious gamers.

Overall, for a perfect balance of cost, performance, and wireless freedom, I’d recommend the Logitech G Pro X Superlight. Let me know if you’d like to move forward or have any questions!
