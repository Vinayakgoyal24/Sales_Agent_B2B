### Core Technologies

#### **Vector Database**
- **Chroma DB**: Primary vector database for storing and retrieving document embeddings
- Optimized for similarity search and retrieval operations
- Supports metadata filtering and hybrid search capabilities

#### **Embedding Model**
- **Azure OpenAI Embedding v3**: High-quality text embeddings for semantic similarity
- Deployed via Azure OpenAI Service for enterprise-grade reliability
- Supports multilingual embedding generation

#### **Generation Model**
- **Azure OpenAI GPT-4.1**: Advanced language model for response generation
- Integrated with Azure OpenAI Service for scalability
- Fine-tuned for sales and customer service contexts

#### **Reranking System**
- **T5 Reranker**: Semantic reranking for improved retrieval relevance
- Post-retrieval ranking to optimize context quality
- Significantly improves response accuracy

#### **Text Processing**
- **Recursive Character Text Splitter**: Intelligent document chunking
- Maintains semantic coherence across text segments
- Optimized chunk sizes for embedding and retrieval

### Architecture Flow

1. **Document Ingestion**: Raw documents are processed and split into semantic chunks
2. **Embedding Generation**: Text chunks are converted to dense vectors using Azure OpenAI Embedding v3
3. **Vector Storage**: Embeddings are stored in Chroma DB with metadata
4. **Query Processing**: User queries are embedded and matched against stored vectors
5. **Retrieval**: Relevant chunks are retrieved using optimized search techniques
6. **Reranking**: T5 reranker improves the relevance order of retrieved chunks
7. **Generation**: GPT-4.1 generates responses using retrieved context
8. **Output Formatting**: Responses are formatted according to requested output type

## RAGAS Experiments and Results

### Experimental Framework

Our RAG system underwent comprehensive evaluation using RAGAS (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment) metrics to optimize performance across multiple dimensions.

### Experiment 1: Search Technique Optimization

**Objective**: Identify the most effective retrieval strategy for our domain-specific data.

**Methods Tested**:
- **BM25**: Traditional keyword-based sparse retrieval
- **Similarity Search**: Dense vector similarity using cosine similarity
- **Hybrid Search**: Combination of BM25 and dense retrieval

**Conclusion**: Similarity search (dense retrieval) provided the best results with highest context precision  and context recall, making it our chosen approach.

### Experiment 2: Reranker Comparison

**Objective**: Evaluate different reranking models to improve retrieval relevance.

**Models Tested**:
- **T5 Reranker**: Transformer-based reranking model
- **ColBERT**: Efficient neural information retrieval
- **MiniLM**: Lightweight sentence transformer
- **BGE**: Beijing Academy of AI's embedding model

**Conclusion**: T5 reranker achieved the highest relevance score with acceptable latency, making it optimal for our quality-focused application.

### Experiment 3: Hyperparameter Optimization

**Objective**: Optimize retrieval parameters for maximum performance.

**Parameter Tested**: Top-K retrieval count

**Configurations**:
- Top-K = 5
- Top-K = 10
- Top-K = 15
- Top-K = 20

**Conclusion**: Top-K = 15 provided the optimal balance between retrieval quality and system performance, with the highest context precision and excellent response quality.

### Final Optimized Configuration

Based on experimental results, our production system uses:
- **Search Method**: Similarity Search (Dense Retrieval)
- **Reranker**: T5 Reranker
